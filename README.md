# micada.org: A personal site

Built using [Gatsby: A React Static Site generator](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)
But (probably heinously) had a ton of it ripped out to serve my purposes.

Things to do:
- Autoprefixer all the things
- Figure out a deploy / build process
- Why does webpack hate faivcons?
- Remove the Foundation pieces I'm not using/going to use
- Add pages, duh 
- Linter/Comb (this is my #1 priority, actually)
- Maybe do something fun with the svg
