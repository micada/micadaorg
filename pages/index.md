title: "Hi. Hello."

#### My name is Mica.

I am a New Media Enthusiast, Non-Profit Devotee, Web/Application Developer, Culture Consultant, Independent Promoter, Coffee Snob, Board Game Addict, Perpetual Student, Reckless Cyclist, Video Game Nerd, Dance Aficionado, Aspiring Foodie, Native Chicagoan, and *Total Square*.

And I play a *mean* game of gin rummy.

I’m not sure there’s much more to say than that. I finished my Masters at DePaul a few years ago and work both at a startup in River North and for Red Bull Music Academy in Chicago. I spend most of my free time playing games.

This is a work in progress, so excuse the sawdust.
