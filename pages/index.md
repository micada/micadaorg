#### My name Is Mica

I am a New Media Enthusiast, Non-Profit Devotee, Culture Consultant, Independent Promoter, Web Developer, Coffee Snob, Gaming Addict, Perpetual Student, Suicidal Cyclist, Complete Nerd, Dance Aficionado, Altruistic Cynic, Native Chicagoan, Apple Drone, and a *Total Square*.

And I play a *mean* game of gin rummy.

I’m not sure there’s much more to say than that. I finished my Masters at DePaul a few years ago and work both at a startup in River North and for Red Bull Music Academy in Chicago. I’m semi-available for freelance work and consultations, so feel free to contact me!
