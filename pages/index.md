title: "Hi. Hello."

### My name is Mica.

I am a New Media Enthusiast, Web/Application Developer, Culture Consultant, Podcast Devotee, Independent Promoter, Coffee Snob, STEM Mentor, Board Game Addict, Perpetual Student, Avid Reader, Event Organizer, Reckless Cyclist, Video Game Nerd, Dance Aficionado, Architecture Nut, Aspiring Foodie, Native Chicagoan, and *Total Square*.

And I play a *mean* game of gin rummy.

I’m not sure there’s much more to say than that. I finished my Masters at DePaul a few years ago and got my undergraduate degree from Loyola. I work at a startup in River North and for Red Bull Music Academy in Chicago. 

This is a work in progress, so excuse the sawdust.
