title: "Hi. Hello."

### My name is Mica.

I am a New Media Enthusiast, Web/App Developer, Culture Consultant, Podcast Devotee, STEM Mentor, Board Game Addict, Perpetual Student, Animal Shelter Volunteer, Avid Reader, Whiskey Drinker, Event Organizer, Reckless Cyclist, Video Game Nerd, Coding Teacher, Dance Aficionado, Architecture Nut, Aspiring Foodie, Native Chicagoan, and *Total Square*.

And I play a *mean* game of gin rummy.

I’m not sure there’s much more to say than that. I finished my Masters at DePaul a few years ago and got my undergraduate degree from Loyola. I work at an agency in Evanston and for Red Bull Music Academy in Chicago. I live in Bucktown and have this thing with coffee where I need it to live.

This is a work in progress, so please excuse the sawdust.
